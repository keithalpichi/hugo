<h1 class="header">My Timeline</h1>

<p>Below is a timeline from when I first started programming to today. I decided to create this to show you the path I took, why I took it, the challenges I faced, the confusion and questions I had, and how I overcame them.</p>

<p>The most important reason why I wanted to create a timeline is to advise and set a path for you so that you can learn effectively and efficiently. When I first started I didn't know where to start. Since I didn't have prior experience or education in computer science I didn't get the guidance or connections I would have received if I was in school. Going back to school wasn't an ideal option for me and it may not be for you as well.</p>

<h2>Why Follow My Timeline?</h2>

<p>So I hope this timeline can help you in the following ways:
<ul>
  <li>Give you guidance to where to start. <b>Of course, if you're looking for a language to start with I recommend Python</b>.</li>
  <li>Provide you with different options based on your interests</li>
  <li>Help you avoid mistakes, wasted time, frustration and confusion</li>
  <li>Help you face and overcome challenges because you WILL face them</li>
  <li>Make you become an effective and efficient programmer</li>
  <li>Point you to the appropriate resources and experts to learn software enginnering</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p><b>At the bottom of this page is my recommendation on how you should learn based on my personal experience</b></p>

<h2>My Timeline</h2>

Prior to programming I managed a Wordpress blogging website for my personal training business. Through blogging I learned the basics of HTML and CSS (the two markup and styling languages of web pages). I am not including this in my timeline because this was before I even thought and decided to pursue a career change to software engineering. However it did contribute to helping me learn HTML and CSS when I really started using it in late October 2015.

<ul>
  <li><b>July 2015- Swift</b>. I started with Swift, the iOS language for Apple applications. I first got into programming because I wanted to build a mobile application. I learned I needed to use a backend language to implement a restful API. I could have used something like a backend provider that takes care of it but to build a large, scalable app that I wanted to build it wasn't for me.
    <ul>
      <li>Why I pursued this path: I wanted to build a mobile software company and the beauty of frontend development was very enticing</li>
      <li>What I thought: I only needed to know Swift and the rest was magic.</li>
      <li>What I learned from this experience: I wanted to build something big, so I was going to have to learn a backend language.</li> 
      <li>Advice: If you work with a team or you want to specialize in frontend mobile/web development you can focus on the frontend language. If you want to build a company out of it and you're a small team, you are going to have to learn a backend language. Otherwise, small applications that don't deal with a lot of data, traffic, etc. will do fine with a backend provider.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>September 2015- Ruby</b>. From what I read online the community is huge and it's widely used with the Rails web framework to build big web applications. I considered Ruby on Rails because of it's wide use and I considered attending a local developer bootcamp that taught it.
    <ul>
      <li>Why I pursued this path: I am not too sure why I first pursued Ruby but I believe it was because of all the suggestions I got or read suggested Ruby.</li>
      <li>What I thought: I didn't like the syntax but I think that was a personal issue of not being able to grasp the basics of programming. Also, I was coming from Swift which syntax was a little different.</li>
      <li>What I learned from this experience: I had to focus not on a language but the basics of computer science, programming and object-oriented programming (OOP).</li>
      <li>Advice: Choose any language but focus on the fundamentals of computer science and OOP. Consider taking an introductory computer science course or visit the <a href="/resources" target="_blank">resource</a> page to watch the free Youtube course of MIT's Introduction to Compter Science and Programming. Also, most if not all Python books and courses cover object-oriented programming. Find my recommended books at the resource page.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>October 9th, 2015- Python</b>. A close friend of mines who was pursuing a computer science degree suggested I try it. 
  <ul>
    <li>Why I pursued this path: I didn't have a good experience with Ruby so I tried Python because I trusted my friends recommendation.</li>
    <li>What I thought: I instantly fell in love with it and <a href="{% post_url 2016-06-28-why-choose-python %}" target="_blank">there are so many reasons why I chose it</a>.</li>
    <li>What I learned from this experience: Python is amazing. If you haven't read the article above, go and read it now.</li>
    <li>Advice: You guessed it, start with Python.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>October 23rd, 2015- Flask</b>. Flask-- the web framework for Python.
    <ul>
      <li>Why I pursued this path: Since I needed to build a RESTful API I was recommended Flask.</li>
      <li>What I thought: The Flask framework is known for being minimal and flexible but still very powerful. I liked this and I can see why many teams big and small choose it. A team can build a backend very quickly.</li>
      <li>What I learned from this experience: While learning Flask there were some things I had trouble fully understanding. Things like requests, decorators, working with databases, just to name a few. However, it wasn't Flask's fault it was my own. I didn't feel confident I knew all of Python and OOP to learn Flask.</li>
      <li>Advice: I can't stress enough the importance of understanding the fundamentals of computer science and OOP. Flask (and other frameworks like Django or Pyramid) just abstracts much of what's going on under the hood. So if you don't understand something dig deeper to understand it better. A simple Google search should provide many results to help you. Before learning a framework make sure you're confident you know OOP and the language that it uses.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Late October, 2015- Git</b>. Check the <a href="/resource">resource page for an explanation</a> of Git if you don't know what it is. 
    <ul>
      <li>Why I pursued this path: Git is a requirement to know. Software programming is not software programming without it. I needed to learn it sooner or later.</li> 
      <li>What I thought: The basics of Git are simple but if you're working with a team it can get pretty nasty if you don't understand how to use it.</li> 
      <li>What I learned from this experience: Git is a flexibile and powerful tool and I believe that is what makes it challenging to learn.</li>
      <li>Advice: Learn Git and a Git repository hosting service such as Github and/or Bitbucket. You're digging yourself a grave if you don't.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Later February to early March, 2016- Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Ansible</b>.
    <ul>
      <li>Why I pursued this path: I was curious how deployment and DevOps worked</li>
      <li>What I thought: It's a whole different level. Building an application on your own machine is one skill. Deploying it and managing it on a server is another.</li>
      <li>What I learned from this experience: I was getting ahead of myself.</li>
      <li>Advice: You will be excited and curious to learn of new technologies and even people will say "X language is the future, learn it now". Instead, stay rooted into your goals and focus on one thing at a time. If what you're doing doesn't directly help you get closer to your goal (learning the fundamentals or building your application) now it's going to push you off track. One exception to this recommendation is when you're trying to learn a new language to learn new paradigms. In the beginning, you should focus on one language. When it comes to deployment, learn it when your first application is ready to be deployed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Late April to early May, 2016- HTML, CSS, Responsive Web Design</b>.
  <ul>
    <li>Why I pursued this path: I was working on a few projects for my portfolio and desperately needed to improve my HTML and CSS skills. Responsive Web Design (RWD) was also something I was interested in applying to my frontend design. Although RWD is not a language it is an approach to web design.</li>
    <li>What I thought: HTML and CSS is pretty easy to grasp. RWD, although not required for frontend, greatly improves the user experience.</li>
    <li>What I learned from this experience: Since I've already learned HTML and CSS two years back it was a good refresher to visit it again. I forgot some aspects of the language before revisiting it again. I also learned new things I didn't learn the first time around.</li> 
    <li>Advice: If you're going to do frontend web development you're going to use HTML and CSS. So learn it and while you're at it learn RWD. Also, sometimes you may need to use a resource as a reference to come back to just in case you forget something or want clarification. The most common reference to use is the documentation of the language or software. There's no better reference than the documentation.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>April 2016- Heroku</b>. Heroku is a cloud application platform that manages the servers, deployment, operations and scaling of a user's application. Basically it's as simple as pushing your code to Heroku and they do the rest of the work to get it published.
    <ul>
      <li>Why I pursued this path: I had some other small projects that I needed deployed. Heroku has had a good reputation for being stress-free to work with.</li>
      <li>What I thought: Deploying my applications to Heroku was easy. Their documentation is made for dummies. They're super easy to understand and follow.</li>
      <li>What I learned from this experience: I may consider using Heroku or AWS's Elastic Beanstalk (EBS) to deploy small projects that I need deployed fast without having to worry about server management and configuration.</li>
      <li>Advice: Use Heroku, EBS, or Google App Engine (all "Platforms As A Service" or PAAS) to deploy applications where you don't mind sacrificing control, flexibility, and scalability for getting an application up and running without the hassle of managing and configuring servers. On the other hand, if you're trying to build a bigger application where you want full control of everything don't use a PAAS but instead consider an "Infrastructure As A Service" (IAAS). These include AWS, Window's Azure, Google App Engine (GAE), and Rackspace Open Cloud.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Early June, 2016- Erlang and Elixir</b>. Erlang and Elixir are functional and concurrent languages. Elixir is built on Erlang is compiled to Erlang.
    <ul>
      <li>Why I pursued this path: As a seasoned engineer will tell you, learning new languages is actually advised. The reason being is that all languages have their strengths and weaknesses, have different paradigms, and implement logic differently (i.e., loops from one language may be done differently in another). I decided to take a few weeks off Python to open up my brain to learn new things.</li>
      <li>What I thought: Coming from an OOP language like Python to a functional concurrent language like Erlang and Elixir was tough. It's a total different paradigm. It is very interesting and in the future I'd like to really dig deeper into it.</li>
      <li>What I learned from this experience: OOP and functional programming are totally different ways of thinking. I wasn't prepared to take a longer break from Python to fully grasp Erlang and Elixir. I'll come back to yet just not now.</li>
      <li>Advice: Once you're comfortable with a language and have developed applications, I encourage you to venture out and learn new languages. That is if you don't mind taking time off your main language. You'll definitely learn new ways of thinking. You can compare and contrast to the languages you know. More importantly learning how one thing is done in one language might help you implement this thing better in another.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
