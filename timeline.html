<h1 class="header">My Timeline</h1>

<p>Below is a timeline from when I first started programming to today. I decided to create this to show you the path I took, why I took it, the challenges I faced, the confusion and questions I had, and how I overcame them.</p>

<p>The most important reason why I wanted to create a timeline is to advise and set a path for you so that you can learn effectively and efficiently. When I first started I didn't know where to start. Since I didn't have prior experience or education in computer science I didn't get the guidance or connections I would have received if I was in school. Going back to school wasn't an ideal option for me and it may not be for you as well.</p>

<h2>Why Follow My Timeline?</h2>

<p>So I hope this timeline can help you in the following ways:
<ul>
  <li>Give you guidance to where to start. <b>Of course, if you're looking for a language to start with I recommend Python</b>.</li>
  <li>Provide you with different options based on your interests</li>
  <li>Help you avoid mistakes, wasted time, frustration and confusion</li>
  <li>Help you face and overcome challenges because you WILL face them</li>
  <li>Make you become an effective and efficient programmer</li>
  <li>Point you to the appropriate resources and experts to learn software enginnering</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>My Timeline</h2>

Prior to programming I managed a Wordpress blogging website for my personal training business. Through blogging I learned the basics of HTML and CSS (the two markup and styling languages of web pages). I am not including this in my timeline because this was before I even thought and decided to pursue a career change to software engineering. However it did contribute to helping me learn HTML and CSS when I really started using it in late October 2015.

<ul>
  <li><b>July 2015- Swift</b>. I started with Swift, the iOS language for Apple applications. I first got into programming because I wanted to build a mobile application. I learned I needed to use a backend language to implement a restful API. I could have used something like a backend provider that takes care of it but to build a large, scalable app that I wanted to build it wasn't for me.
    <ul>
      <li>Why I pursued this path: I wanted to build a mobile software company and the beauty of frontend development was very enticing</li>
      <li>What I thought: I only needed to know Swift and the rest was magic.</li>
      <li>What I learned from this experience: I wanted to build something big, so I was going to have to learn a backend language.</li> 
      <li>Advice: If you work with a team or you want to specialize in frontend mobile/web development you can focus on the frontend language. If you want to build a company out of it and you're a small team, you are going to have to learn a backend language. Otherwise, small applications that don't deal with a lot of data, traffic, etc. will do fine with a backend provider.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>September 2015- Ruby</b>. From what I read online the community is huge and it's widely used with the Rails web framework to build big web applications. I considered Ruby on Rails because of it's wide use and I considered attending a local developer bootcamp that taught it.
    <ul>
      <li>Why I pursued this path: I am not too sure why I first pursued Ruby but I believe it was because of all the suggestions I got or read suggested Ruby.</li>
      <li>What I thought: I didn't like the syntax but I think that was a personal issue of not being able to grasp the basics of programming. Also, I was coming from Swift which syntax was a little different.</li>
      <li>What I learned from this experience: I had to focus not on a language but the basics of computer science, programming and object-oriented programming (OOP).</li>
      <li>Advice: Choose any language but focus on the fundamentals of computer science and OOP. Consider taking an introductory computer science course or visit the <a href="/resources" target="_blank">resource</a> page to watch the free Youtube course of MIT's Introduction to Compter Science and Programming. Also, most if not all Python books and courses cover object-oriented programming. Find my recommended books at the resource page.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>October 9th, 2015- Python</b>. A close friend of mines who was pursuing a computer science degree suggested I try it. 
  <ul>
    <li>Why I pursued this path: I didn't have a good experience with Ruby so I tried Python because I trusted my friends recommendation.</li>
    <li>What I thought: I instantly fell in love with it and <a href="{% post_url 2016-06-28-why-choose-python %}" target="_blank">there are so many reasons why I chose it</a>.</li>
    <li>What I learned from this experience: Python is amazing. If you haven't read the article above, go and read it now.</li>
    <li>Advice: You guessed it, start with Python.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>October 23rd, 2015- Flask</b>. Flask-- the web framework for Python.
    <ul>
      <li>Why I pursued this path: Since I needed to build a RESTful API I was recommended Flask.</li>
      <li>What I thought: The Flask framework is known for being minimal and flexible but still very powerful. I liked this and I can see why many teams big and small choose it. A team can build a backend very quickly.</li>
      <li>What I learned from this experience: While learning Flask there were some things I had trouble fully understanding. Things like requests, decorators, working with databases, just to name a few. However, it wasn't Flask's fault it was my own. I didn't feel confident I knew all of Python and OOP to learn Flask.</li>
      <li>Advice: I can't stress enough the importance of understanding the fundamentals of computer science and OOP. Flask (and other frameworks like Django or Pyramid) just abstracts much of what's going on under the hood. So if you don't understand something dig deeper to understand it better. A simple Google search should provide many results to help you. Before learning a framework make sure you're confident you know OOP and the language that it uses.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Late October, 2015- Git</b>. Check the <a href="/resource">resource page for an explanation</a> of Git if you don't know what it is. 
    <ul>
      <li>Why I pursued this path: Git is a requirement to know. Software programming is not software programming without it. I needed to learn it sooner or later.</li> 
      <li>What I thought: The basics of Git are simple but if you're working with a team it can get pretty nasty if you don't understand how to use it.</li> 
      <li>What I learned from this experience: Git is a flexibile and powerful tool and I believe that is what makes it challenging to learn.</li>
      <li>Advice: Learn Git and a Git repository hosting service such as Github and/or Bitbucket. You're digging yourself a grave if you don't.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Later February to Early March, 2016- Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Ansible</b>.
    <ul>
      <li>Why I pursued this path: I was curious how deployment and DevOps worked</li>
      <li>What I thought: It's a whole different level. Building an application on your own machine is one skill. Deploying it and managing it on a server is another.</li>
      <li>What I learned from this experience: I was getting ahead of myself.</li>
      <li>Advice: You will be excited and curious to learn of new technologies and even people will say "X language is the future, learn it now". Stay rooted into your goals and focus on one thing at a time. If what you're doing doesn't directly help you get closer to your goal (learning the fundamentals or building your application) now it's going to push you off track. When it comes to deployment, learn it when your first application is ready to be deployed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
