<h1 class="header">My Timeline</h1>

<p>Below is a timeline from when I first started programming to today. I decided to create this to show you the path I took, why I took it, the assumptions and questions I had, the challenges I faced and how I overcame them.</p>

<p>The reason why I wanted to create a timeline is to advise and set a path for you so that you can learn to program effectively and efficiently. When I first started I didn't know where to start and I had my <a href="{% post_url 2016-07-01-assumptions-myths-self-taught-programmer %}" target="_blank">assumptions about learning software programming</a>.</p>

<p>Since I didn't have prior experience or education in computer science I didn't get the guidance or connections I would have received if I was in school. Going back to school wasn't an ideal option for me and it may not be for you as well.</p>

<h2>Why Follow My Timeline?</h2>

<p>So I hope this timeline can help you in the following ways:
<ul>
  <li>Give you guidance to where to start and clear up confusion and assumptions about software programming</li> 
  <li>Provide you with different options based on your interests</li>
  <li>Help you avoid mistakes, wasted time, frustration and confusion</li>
  <li>Help you face and overcome challenges because you WILL face them</li>
  <li>Make you become an effective and efficient programmer</li>
  <li>Point you to the appropriate resources and experts to learn software enginnering</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p><b>At the bottom of this page is the link to my guide on how you should learn based on my personal experience</b>. Before going there I suggest you read this page first.</p>

<h2>My Timeline</h2>

Prior to programming I managed a Wordpress blogging website for my personal training business. Through blogging I learned the basics of HTML and CSS (the two markup and styling languages of web pages). I am not including this in my timeline because this was before I even thought and decided to pursue a career change to software engineering. However it did contribute to help refresh my HTML and CSS skills when I really started using it again in late October 2015.

<p>Check out my published applications and projects at the <a href="/projects">projects page</a>. I will be updating this page by adding to the section above. Check back often if you'd like to see how things change.</p>

<h2>How I Would Learn To Code If I Could Go Back In Time</h2>

<p>I've written a comprehensive <a href="{% post_url 2016-06-30-guideline-self-taught-programmer %}" target="_blank">step-by-step guide to becoming a self-taught software programmer</a> based on my personal experiences listed above. If there was one last page you needed to visit before leaving this website, the link above would be it. Please take a look it now.
