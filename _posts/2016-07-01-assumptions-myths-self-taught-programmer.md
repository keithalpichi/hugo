When I first started to learn programming I had a lot of questions and assumptions about the software world. I was very intimidated by the idea of entering a world where I thought geniuses only lived. However, from what I learned my assumption was far from the truth.

Learning to code is challenging but it's not impossible. I built this website solely around this idea. With the right directions you can learn how to make beautiful things.

Here are some assumptions you may have about becoming a self-taught programming:

## Assumption: I need to be a math genius to be able to code

When I tell people that I am teaching myself how to code most show a sour face and reply with something along the lines of, "you have to know a ton of math huh?" I giggle and respond with a, "no not that much really."

Yet it all depends on your career goals. If you trying to be a web developer you won't need to know as much math as a data scientist. Don't get me wrong it helps to know math, calculus, and linear algebra but basic high school mathematics will be enough to get in the right direction.

To make you feel better I took algebra and pre-calculus in high school and statistics in college for my kinesiology degree. I got low A's in high school math and barely passed college statistics. To be honest, it was partly due to the fact I didn't try to excel at math. 

**Truth**: If you can add, subtract, multiply, divide and use other basic mathematics you'll have the minimum skills to get started. It helps to know <a href="/resources/#computer-science" target="_blank">calculus, linear algebra, and statistics</a>. Obviously if you're going to pursue a career that is math intensive you'll have to learn more. It depends on the path you're going to take and if you need to you can always learn more math. 

## Assumption: I must have a computer science degree to get a career in the software industry

Having a C.S. degree helps but with the large amount of free and paid courses, textbooks, tutorials, online and local programming bootcamps, conferences and meetups you can learn to program on your own or with the help of others. The issue is this: without a C.S. degree and internship(s) an employer can't tell if you have the skills, education and experience to code. So are you screwed? Not entirely.

If you don't have a degree you're going to have to expose your skills and experience by building applications and contributing to open-source projects. This will show that you know how to code and you have passion to contribute to the industry.

Many employers will hire a person who has multiple years of practical experience but no C.S. degree over a person who has a degree with no practical experience. Experience trumps education.

**Truth**: Formal education helps but practical experience is even more helpful. Build projects, contribute to other projects and attend conferences and meetings where you can network with other programmers and employers.

## Assumption: It will take a long time to learn

Obviously anything that you learn takes time. I don't need to explain that any further. However, to be a software programmer you will have to learn and that will take time. I started learning in November 2015 but I didn't get serious until January 2016. I put in about four to six hours a day five to six days a week learning. Today is July 2016 and I feel confident in my ability to write complete programs. 

**Truth**: the more time you put in to learning *and applying* programming skills the more you will get out as a result. It took me about seven months to be competent in programming. You may or may not learn faster than me. However, it's important to focus not on the time spent but on the quality of the knowledge you gain.

The real beauty of teaching yourself how to program is that you have the freedom to learn at your own rate. Compare this to pursuing a degree. In college you're tied down to a semester length of time. If you feel competent in your knowledge in the course you can't take the final early and advance to the next course. You have to wait until the end of the semester. 

## The One Truth to Squash All Assumptions

I am sure there are plenty other assumptions but these three are the most common. We live in a time where technology and information is easily accessible. If you need to access anything you open your *smartphone*. If you want to learn something you *Google* it. It's that simple. 

So what I think is more important than having the knowledge and formal education is *first* having the passion to learn and challenge yourself and the persistence to stick it out.
