- Basic understanding of the HTTP protocol, Javascript, Node, and Express

## What are Middlewares?

From the documentation,

> Middlewares are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.

To give you a relatable picture, Express middleware's are the workers in a manufacturing line where each individual has a specific and unique responsibility. On each product (request) that a worker receives, they can do **one** of the following:
 - **reject** the product if it doesn't meet strict standards, thus the product ceases to continue down the production line
 - **add or manipulate** the product and/or **allow** the product to continue down the production line where the next worker (middleware) does their job

Here are few [middlewares](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware.html) you may have used in the past:
  - 'body-parser'- parses the request body and places it into the 'req.body' key of the request object
  - 'express.static'- serves your static files
  - 'express.logger'- uses a logger

All you had to do was add these to your Express application or route and BAM... you had more functionality! It seems like magic but it's actually quite simple.

In this article I'll go over the details of middlewares and some useful examples showcasing the flexibility and power of middlewares.

## Req, Res, Next

Middlewares have access to three things:
  - the 'request' object
  - the 'response' object
  - the 'next' function

{% highlight javascript %}
function customMiddleware (req, res, next) {
  //...
}
{% endhighlight %}

Since you have access to the [request](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req) and [response](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res), you can do almost anything you want. You can extract or add information to and from either one. You would call 'next()' if you want to continue the request and pass it on to the next middleware or end the request right there.

## Middleware Chain

So you create the custom middleware, now what? You add it to the middleware chain. Middlewares are called in the order they're set.

{% highlight javascript %}
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
app.use(express.bodyParser)
app.use(customMiddleware)
{% endhighlight %}

- On every request these two middlewares will run- 'bodyParser' will run first before the one below it

{% highlight javascript %}
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
app.get('/some/path', customMiddleware, customMiddleware2)

const apiRouter = express.Router()
apiRouter.use(customMiddleware2)
app.use('/api', apiRouter)
{% endhighlight %}

You can have middlewares run on specific routes.
- 'customMiddleware' will run first followed by 'customMiddleware2' for the 'GET' method on the path '/some/path'
- Only 'customMiddleware2' will run for all requests to the 'apiRouter'


Cool huh? Let's see some other useful examples!

## A Simple Logger- Log Date and URL Path

In this example I extract and log some data specific to the request, then pass the request to the next middleware by using the 'next' function. The request or response is not altered in any way. I'll show an example of that next.

{% highlight javascript %}
function datePathLogger (req, res, next) {
  const date = new Date().toUTCString()
  console.log(`Request to '${req.path}' on ${date}`)
  next()
}
{% endhighlight %}

A request to a url 'www.foo.com/bar' would log

{% highlight bash %}
Request to '/bar' on Mon, 17 Jul 2017 01:01:38 GMT
{% endhighlight %}

After the 'console.log' function ran the 'next' function was called. At this point the request and response would be handed to the next middleware.

## Token Parser- Parse User ID from JWT Token

In this example I parse the request object for the JWT token to get the user's id. If it doesn't exist I end the request and send back a status code of 401. At this point the request stops. If it does exist I place the user's id into 'req.user_id' then call 'next()'. Note that the key 'user_id' is arbitrary. I could have used 'req.users_identification_number'.

{% highlight javascript %}
function tokenParser (req, res, next) {
  const user_id = parseTokenForUserID(req) // This is a made-up function that parses the user's ID from the request object
  if (!user_id) {
    res.sendStatus(401)
  } else {
    req.user_id = user_id
    next()
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now in every succeeding middleware or request handler I have access to the user's id at 'req.user_id'.

## Environment-specific Middleware

Since middleware's are just functions you can have functionality based on different environments or configuration. Say, for example, we wanted to perform descriptive logging for development environments.

{% highlight javascript %}
function logger (env) {
  if (env === 'development') {
    return function (req, res, next) {
      // perform descriptive logs better suited for development environments
    }
  } else {
    return function (req, res, next) {
      // perform none or minimal logging
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Then add this middleware by **calling** it with the environment

{% highlight javascript %}
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
app.use(logger(process.env.NODE_ENV))
{% endhighlight %}

These may not be practical examples you'd actually use in production but the illustration should provide some clarity on the flexibility of middlewares.

## Harness the Elegance Of Middlewares

I love how the flow in Express middleware's are very explicit. It makes code intuitive, super flexible, and easy to read. If you're not creating custom middlewares I highly encourage you take advantage of their simplicity and power.
