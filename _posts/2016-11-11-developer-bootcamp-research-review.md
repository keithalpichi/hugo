> Important Note- I am no way affiliated with any of the developer bootcamps in this article. Publication of this article was not influenced by anyone other than myself. I do not get any money or recognition for this article. My motivation behind this article is to help other developers get more information about bootcamps they may consider attending and also offer a personal review of bootcamps I researched myself.

On Monday November 7th 2016 I received an email from Hackreactor informing me I got into their on-site immersive 12-week program. Two months prior I didn't even consider applying to any local bootcamps.

In this article I'd like to explain why I decided to apply to local bootcamps, an overview and criticism of two of them, how I prepared for their intensive interviews and my experience with the interviews themselves.

At the end of the article I explain which one I chose as well as some advice about choosing one yourself.

## Two months back

I never even considered attending a developer bootcamp and I think this was largely due to the fact that I was sure I could teach myself without going back to school, or in this case attending a developer bootcamp.

Up until two months back I struggled to maintain a structured learning path. I bounced around a lot (as you can see in my [timeline](/timeline)) and I had been confronted with a lot of issues, bugs and frustration. I learned a lot but not at the rate I wanted to. So I looked at other options to help speed up my learning rate.

## Bootcamp criteria

Here are some criteria I set for possible bootcamps I would attend:

<table>
<tbody>
  <th>Criteria</th>
  <th>Comments</th>
  <tr>
    <td>Location</td>
    <td>I didn't want to travel out of state so I only looked at local bootcamps located in Silicon Valley, California since I lived here.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Tuition costs & tuition model</td>
    <td>Pay up-front, pay during the program or pay after I get a job? Does the bootcamp offer scholarships and/or payment plans? I would like a bootcamp that offered more payment options.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reviews</td>
    <td>What are students, both graduates and drop-outs, saying about the bootcamp? What about those who applied, took the interview and didn't get in? For me any bootcamp that received less than 90% positive reviews did not qualify.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Outcomes</td>
    <td>What's the percentage of graduates who get careers in a <i>relevant</i> field? What's the average salary? What companies do graduates work at? How are the bootcamps collecting these statistics? How accurate are they? Is the bootcamp transparent about their program? This probably was the most important criteria for me. How likely am I going to get a career in a relevant field and at what average salary will I be receiving? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Curriculum</td>
    <td>How is the curriculum structured and is it up-to-date? What technologies do they teach? How do they teach? I wanted to learn technologies that are in demand and learn best practices that will make me a successful software engineer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Experience and expectations</td>
    <td>Does the bootcamp challenge you? Do they have high expectations? Are the staff supportive and what makes them qualified to teach? I wanted a bootcamp that has high expectations and teach real-world best practices</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

I researched a ton of bootcamps and I narrowed it down to two; Appacademy and Hackreactor. I won't cover other bootcamps; just know I didn't choose them because they didn't meet my criteria above. I decided to only apply to Appacademy at the moment and the next section explains why.

## [Appacademy](https://www.appacademy.io)

I applied to Appacademy sometime in September 2016.

#### Review

Here were some of the reasons why I applied to Appacademy:

- It got great reviews, a high percentage of graduates get careers and their tuition plan is pretty neat- pay a $5k deposit up front and only pay the rest of tuition if you get a job after the program. If you get a job within a certain time period after graduation you pay ~18-22% of your first years salary. If not you don't pay any more fees. I am not sure if you get your deposit back.
- I was currently learning Elixir and it's syntax looked very similar to Ruby. The program was in Ruby so I though it wouldn't be too hard to transition to. Plus a lot of companies who are incorporating Elixir into their stack were or are currently using Ruby. I felt experience in both would be valuable.
- Their curriculum was up to date- they teach Ruby, Rails, React, Redux. They did use Backbone a few months back but now they've switched to React and Redux. I also had a basic understanding of the React and Redux model.

#### Application process

You fill out an application and are sent instructions to submit your solutions to a set of problems. You're also provided free resources to help prepare you for the problems. You have the freedom to solve the problems in the language of your choice and have 45 minutes to complete them.

You submit your solutions and get an email a week later about the next steps. If you did well you schedule a live video interview where you solve problems in front of interviewer. If you didn't do well you move on to another yet more challenging problem set. I assume you repeat this process until you advance to the video interview.

#### Interview prep

> Along with the resources I share here find more detailed resources at my [resources](/resources) page

Appacademy provides another link to resources to prepare for the live interview. The links to these resources are tagged with the applicants ID so unfortunately I can't share mine. Plus it has expired. You'll get your link when you apply.

The resources are free tutorial/course websites and free books to learn Ruby; nothing you can't find by doing a quick Google search. On top of these resources I used [exercism.io](https://exercism.io) and [codewars.com](https://codewars.com) to practice. I also read through [Eloquent Ruby](http://amzn.to/2eQgfhV).

It has also helped that I have been teaching myself programming for the past year using the resources I have shared at my [resources page](/resources).

#### Interview process

Fortunately I advanced to the video interview. It was tough and I made some mistakes. I didn't get the right solutions but I was confident my logic was in the right place. However, Appacademy rejected my admission into their program. I didn't receive any feedback in the rejection email but was told I could apply again in one months time and submit my solutions to the first 30 problems at Projecteuler.net. I could only apply once more. I was told they'd review my solutions and contact me with the next steps.

#### Post-interview

Me being an ambitious person I did not hesitate to accept their offer to apply again so I decided I'd complete the 30 problems and submit them to Appacademy in one month. I also decided that it wouldn't hurt to open my options so it was time I applied to Hackreactor.

## [Hackreactor](http://www.hackreactor.com)

I hadn't applied to Hackreactor until after I got rejected from Appacademy because I originally favored Appacademy's tuition plan. Also I didn't research Hackreactor too much as my mind was already set on Appacademy. Yet since I got rejected I had to open my options. By the end of this article you'll see why I changed my mind about both bootcamps.

#### Review

Here are some reasons why I applied to Hackreactor:
- They're regarded as one of the best developer bootcamps in Silicon Valley, Ca
- 98% of graduates get careers in a *relevant* field- "developer, software engineer or coder. Product management, data analyst, designer, etc. donâ€™t count as successes in [their] outcomes statistics."
- Graduates can expect to earn their tuition back within 10 weeks after getting hired.
- Their curriculum is up to date- they teach full-stack Javascript

#### Application process

Applicants are first asked to complete an application that requires some beginner knowledge of Javascript syntax and simple data structures. Afterwards you're asked to schedule an interview.
#### Interview prep

Hackreactor gives you [links to resources](http://www.hackreactor.com/free-resources) to prepare for the first interview. Although they're good resources I didn't use them. Instead I quickly read through [Learning Javascript](http://amzn.to/2f0fG2E) and practiced at [exercism.io](http://www.exercism.io) and [codewars.com](https://codewars.com). I also practiced building small applications with React and Redux prior to applying.

I assumed there would be multiple interviews with each subsequent one harder than the previous one. Hackreactor makes it clear you don't have to know everything for the first interview so I didn't need to master Javascript just yet. At this point I felt prepared.

#### Interview process

In the live video interview you solve problems in front of an interviewer. After 7-10 days you'll get instructions on the next steps.

The interview was not as hard as I thought. I was quite surprised especially since I heard their interviews are the hardest ones out there. I expected the interview to be extremely hard so I spent many hours preparing for it. I guess I prepared well. Or maybe I got lucky?

I had a few minor mistakes but since I was explaining my logic and debugging out loud I was able to find my mistakes, fix them and solve the problem. I was confident I did well but not perfect.

I impatiently waited for two weeks for their response. On a Monday morning a few weeks later I got an email stating I got accepted! Woohoo!

#### Post-interview

So at this point I had thought of a few things- do I continue the 30 ProjectEuler problems and apply to Appacademy again or do I focus all my time and energy preparing for the Hackreactor program? I had some comparing to do.

## The battle for my decision

I liked Appacademy's tuition model only because you didn't have to pay until you get a job. However, you end up paying more the higher you earn. Obviously I wasn't attending a bootcamp to earn as little as possible. I liked Hackreactor's set tuition. No matter how much I earn I pay the set tuition fee. The drawback is that I have to basically pay it up-front.

**Tuition- Hackreactor** (Hackreactor 1, Appacademy 0)

I enjoy Elixir and want to continue using it. Some Ruby on Rails companies are starting to incorporate Elixir into their stack. In this case both Ruby and Elixir experience would be valuable. I also like React and Redux over other JS frameworks. So I favored Appacademy's tech stack over Hackreactor's. However it wasn't too much of a deal as programming fundamentals don't change between languages.

**Tech stack- Both are really good** (Hackreactor 2, Appacademy 1)

Hackreactor is extremely transparent about their program and the student outcome statistics. If you go to their website and/or email them directly you'll find tons of useful statistics (even visual charts and graphs). I really liked that Hackreactor does not count product managers, data analysts, designers, and other fields not relevant to software engineering into their statistic. Appacademy wasn't very clear on this so I emailed them to find out. They responded with "graduates get full stack, back end and front end positions."

**Student outcomes and transparency- Hackreactor** (Hackreactor 3, Appacademy 1)

With Appacademy I really didn't like that I had to solve many problem sets just to get to the first live video interview. I understand they want to "weed out" the unmotivated and beginners but it was time-consuming. I submitted my solutions then had to wait a week or two to do it again. This can easily last over a month or two.

I am not too sure how Hackreactor's interview process works since I got accepted after the first live video interview. I'm sure you have multiple interviews. I believe I've read you have small projects that you have to submit between the interviews.

**Interview preparation and process- None, unfair comparison** (Hackreactor 3, Appacademy 1)

I wanted a bootcamp to have high expectations of their students just like I'd want high expectations of a bootcamp. I wanted to be challenged. I didn't want my tuition going into a program that I can do on my own. I feel both do a very good job of this.

**Expectations and value of curriculum- Both** (Hackreactor 4, Appacademy 2)

#### My decision

So I've decided to not re-apply to Appacademy and focus all my time and energy for the next two months preparing for Hackreactor's intensive 12-week program. If felt nice knowing I got accepted into a program that has a low acceptance rate and tough interviews. It was slightly discouraging to have to re-apply to Appacademy even when I got rejected before. I feel more confident going with Hackreactor for the reasons above. I feel Hackreactor has put more effort into their program, curriculum and displaying honest information on their website.

## Should you attend a developer bootcamp?

If you're like me and you've been teaching yourself and don't like the progress you've been making I don't think it would hurt to consider attending one.

If you're in school and pursuing a computer science degree I would suggest to stay in school and finish. Even though the rate of learning may be slower you're getting a degree and some practical experience. I wouldn't recommend dropping out unless you have a really good reason to.

Obviously I can't answer this question for you and everyone has unique situations and certain restrictions. I think it's important to weigh your pros and cons when you do your research. Consider the criteria I posted above and my advice below for some help.

## Advice

- Do your research and narrow your search based on your own criteria
- Explore every section of the bootcamp's website, Yelp, Quora, Facebook, online forums and blog articles to get more information
- Contact the bootcamp's office directly if you have any questions that you can't find on their website. If they are open to all questions that means they take pride in their program. A good bootcamp program should be transparent.
- Practice, practice, practice. More specifically- code, code and code some more
  - Know and practice your data structures and algorithms (check out the [resource](/resources) page for resource recommendations)
  - Practice solving problems under time constraints. I got really anxious knowing I had 'x' amount of time left to solve a problem I had trouble solving. In the live interviews you have limited time so you must solve the problems fast. When you practice, time yourself. Come back later, delete your previous code and beat your time.
  - Practice solving problems while being watched. In coding interviews the interviewer is watching and listening to you. If you don't talk through your logic and code there's no way for the interviewer to know if you know what you're doing or if you're going in the right or wrong direction. If you're silent they can only assume you don't know what you're doing. Before you start coding talk about how you're going to approach the problem and explain each step while you're doing it. If you get stuck or make a mistake explain the problem and what you think is causing it.
  - Check out Jeff Lee's articles on his research and experience with various [coding bootcamps](http://rebootjeff.github.io/blog/2013/09/10/coding-bootcamp-research-admissions-processes-applications-and-interviews-part-1/). I found them to be extremely helpful when it came to choosing a developer bootcamp. Although they are a little outdated they are much more extensive than this article.

## Should I share my experience at Hackreactor?

I'd like to share my experience of the program as I attend it but I know it's going to be really intense and take a lot of my time. However if I get enough requests I just might write a weekly article or something. If you think I should share my experiences tweet me or comment below.
