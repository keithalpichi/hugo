I really like Python and today I'd like to talk about why I chose it as my first language to learn. This post is not about bashing other languages but to share my personally opinions about the language and community.

Here are my reasons why I chose Python:

- It's easy to get started, learn, and code with. Universities and even k-12 schools use Python as an introductory language because of it's shallow learning curve. Yet there's nothing elementary about it.
- I like the syntax. It's clear and minimal.
  {% highlight python %}
> my_name = 'Keith Alpichi'
> print(my_name)
> Keith Alpichi
  {% endhighlight %}
- It has a humongous community and fantastic support. Search your issues online with "python <your issue/question here>" and you'll get a ton of stuff that will help resolve your issue or question.
- Big tech companies use it-- Google, Youtube, Dropbox, Instagram, Netflix, Twitter, Paypal, Uber, Pinterest, and more (stat from stackshare.io/python). This statistic alone should be enough evidence to choose Python.
- It's used in almost every industry- web development, data science, mathematics, machine learning, robotics, natural sciences, network programming, image and video processing in movies and pictures, and more. What ever you can think of building you can build with Python. Seriously!
- It has an extensive amount of python packages that are easily accessible. As of June 28th, 2016 there are 83357 packages (stat from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi)). Each day it gets bigger and better. Most of the time there's a library in PyPI that you can use. You don't have to reinvent the wheel. 
  - It's as simple as:
  {% highlight python %}
> pip install <the_pypi_package_here> 
  {% endhighlight %}

## Should You Choose Python?

My reasons for Python just touched the surface. The only way to find out if it's for you if you try it out and build something with it.

If you haven't decided on a language just make sure to do your research.
View the language's community, documentation, and support. Download the language and build something.

More importantly, don't get tied up on a single language. As you learn, you'll find yourself having to learn other languages. That shouldn't scare you though as each language has it's strengths and weaknesses. You will hear often that a language itself is not the *silver bullet*, it's what you build with it that matters.

However, I do suggest you give Python a try first. Hopefully you see what I see in Python. 

## If You Use Python, Why Do You Use It?

For those who do use Python, why did you choose it and why do you continue to use it? I am sure your answers will add to my list of why Python is a great language.
