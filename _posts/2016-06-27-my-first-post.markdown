Here is my first impression of Jekyll- the static site generator in which this blog is built on:

{% highlight python %}
def output_magic(msg):
    """Accept markdown string and returns magic!"""
    return "{} is MAGIC!!!".format(msg)

output_magic("Jekyll, Markdown, and Github together")

> "Jekyll, Markdown, and Github together is MAGIC!!!"
{% endhighlight %}

Couldn't have explained it better! If you're new to Python and don't understand the code above it's basically saying that I had a pleasant experience setting up my blog with Jekyll.

## Welcome!

Thank you for stopping by. My plan for this blog is simple-- I'd like to...

- share my experiences as a self-taught software enginner/programmer
- give tips, tricks, advice on learning software engineering, what I've learned, how to learn fast and efficient, and how I've overcome challenges and *coders* block.
- showcase the work I've been able to develop along the way
- share my current and future projects and personal goals
- and provide help and motivation to newcomers

## Tip #!

If you're new to software, have no or little experience in software programming the first and most important tip I advise is to get a mentor. At least one. I hope I can be your mentor but if I am not search around your community, attend Meetups and conferences, join Facebook groups, create Reddit, Github and Stackoverflow accounts. The only way to learn, and to learn fast is to surround yourself with better programmers.

## Follow me and ask me questions

I'm not a wizard Python engineer but I'll try my best to help you out. I'd encourage you to follow me here and on Twitter at [@keithalpichi]({{ site.myTwitter }})
