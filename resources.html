<h2>Shoud You Use Python?</h2>

<p><a href="{% post_url 2016-06-28-why-choose-python %}">Why I Chose Python</a><p>

<h2>Free & Paid Books, Courses, &amp; Articles</h2>

<p>Below is a comprehensive guide of all the resources I have collected that has helped me learn software programming, computer science, and web development. It's not 100% complete (I don't think it ever will be) but check back often for updates. If you have any recommendations on a resource that should be here, please tweet me.</p>

<p>Most of the resources below are free but some are paid. The free resources are labeled as free. Those that aren't labeled, I have provided links to where you can purchase them.</p>

<h2>Computer Science Basics</h2>

<p>
If you want to write and talk computer, you must know the basics of computer science. These courses and textbooks are a good introduction to computer science because they use Python as the language. Low-level understanding of computer science requires learning the language that Python is built upon (C language). However, these resources are good enough to get you going on the right track without having to learn stuff like memory management- which Python does for you. If you want to learn C, you can of course.

</ul>

<h2>Command Line, Git &amp; Github</h2>

<p>
Git is a verson control system and Github is a web-based Git repository hosting service. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a graphical interface. Basically you use Git to track, add and revert code changes. Github is where you'd host these changes. Github and Git backs up your code with the power of viewing, editing, adding, removing, and collaborating on your own or your team's past, present and future code.
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2" target="_blank">Pro Git</a>- open source online book. Probably my favorite resource for learning Git.</li>

  <li><a href="https://git-scm.com/documentation" target="_blank">Git Documentation</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/" target="_blank">Git Guide</a>- a simple git guide by Roger Dudler. It doesn't cover everything but it's a quick tutorial to get you on the right track.</li> 
  <li><a href="https://guides.github.com" target="_blank">Github Documentation</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Python</h2>

<p>
  Learning Python resources
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.diveintopython3.net" target="_blank">Dive Into Python 3</a>- free online textbook by Mark Pilgrim. I loved his approach in this book.</li>
  <li><a href="http://amzn.to/29llGRk" target="_blank">Starting Out in Python</a>- book by Tony Gaddis</li>
  <li><a href="http://amzn.to/29cp02t" target="_blank">Learning Python</a>- deep introduction into the Python language. This book is huge but it covers it all. It will take a long time to finish but it's worth it.</li>
  <li><a href="http://amzn.to/295hdUT" target="_blank">Fluent Python</a>- book by Luciano Ramalho. If you find yourself asking, "I've learned the basics of Python where do I go next?" If you haven't read Learning Python, this book should be next.</li>
  <li><a href="http://amzn.to/295hjMn" target="_blank">Effective Python</a>- book by Brett Slatkin based on the 'Effective LANGUAGE-HERE' series but in Python. If you think you write good Python, give this book a try. I bet it will make you write better Pythonic code.</li>
  <li><a href="http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/index.html" target="_blank">Think Python</a>- free online book by Allen Downey. I have yet to read this one, partly because I've read the others above, but the title "Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist" implies it all. Since your coding in the language of computers it's important to think like a computer. With that in mind you'll write great code.</li>

<h2>Client/Frontend Web Development- HTML, CSS, Javascript, &amp; Design</h2>

<p>
If you're going to build an application/program that the user msut interact with then you're going to have to learn client/frontend (the user) development. HTML, CSS, and Javascript (JS) are the foundational languages for this. All websites use these three languages.
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177" target="_blank">HTTP Protocol</a>- an article explaining the HTTP protocol- the foundation of the internet. It is required to know this before jumping into web development.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web" target="_blank">HTML &amp; CSS</a>- free course from Codecademy</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/" target="_blank">HTML</a> free course from W3Schools.com</li>
  <li><a href="http://alistapart.com/about" target="_blank">AListApart.com</a>- is a blogging website for people who make websites. A List Apart explores the design, development, and meaning of web content.</li>
  <li><a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net" target="_blank">Eloquent Javascript</a>- free online book by Marijn Haverbeke. I have yet to read this book but when I need it I will.</li>
  <li><a href="<F28>http://speakingjs.com/es5/" target="_blank">Speaking Javascript</a>- free online book by Dr. Axel Rauschmayer. I have yet to read this book but when I need it I will.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Backend/Server Web Development in Python</h2>

<p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world">Flask Tutorials</a> free online tutorial by Miguel Grinberg. Last updated in 2014.</li>

<h2>Databases- SQL, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL</h2>

<p>
When your application has to save data such as user's information (i.e., name, address, etc.), game information (i.e., wins, losses, points, money, etc), you use a database. SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is used to manage this data in a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and more. 
</p>
<p>
You'd use SQLAlchemy as a wrapper around the RDBMS to use Python classes and methods to represent SQL tables and queries. SQLAlchemy makes it easier to interact with the data in the RDBMS. 
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/" target="_blank">Learn SQL the Hard Way</a> free online textbook by Zed Shaw</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/index.html" target="_blank">PostgreSQL Documentation</a>- a relational database</li>
  <li><a href="http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/" target="_blank">SQLAlchemy Documentation</a>- an object relation mapper for working with databases and Python.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Deployment</h2>

<p>
Once you've got an application that you'd like to serve to the world it's time to deploy it. But how? Look below.
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.fullstackpython.com" target="_blank">Fullstackpython.com</a>- a complete resource on the necessary skills and technologies to be a well-rounded Python developer.</li> 
  <li><a href="http://www.deploypython.com" target="_blank">Full Stack Python Guide to Deployment</a> by Matthew Makai. The go-to resource to get your Python application built, deployed and managed in the cloud.</li>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services Documentation</a>- Although these docs feel like you're lost in the Amazon (pun intended), they are really good at giving you the information you're looking for. If you use AWS with your Python app, you're most likely going to use <a href="https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">Boto3</a>- the AWS SDK for Python</li>
  <li><a href="http://amzn.to/29lorm0" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services in Action</a>- a book by Andreas Wittig that is a great introduction to AWS. You'll learn about the best practices regarding security, high availability and scalability.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
  If you have a Python application that you'd like deployed quickly without the hassle of setting up servers then Heroku or AWS's Elastic Beanstalk may be for you.
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/elastic-beanstalk/" target="_blank">Elastic Beanstalk</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/python" target="_blank">Heroku Documentation</a></li>
