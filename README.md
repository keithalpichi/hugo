# [Keith Alpichi's] Portfolio Blog

## About me and my blog
- I'm a self-taught Python software engineer (can I call myself that? LOL). I've been learning to code/program since November 2015 but only got seriosly into it in January 2016.
- I created this blog to share my experience and what I have learned since the beginning. I encourage anyone who is just starting out by teaching themselves to follow my blog.
