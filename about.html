  Aloha!
</h1>

<p>
  Hi, my name is Keith Alpichi. I am a full-stack software engineer in San Jose, California. I enjoy building performant and scalable real-time applications from the intuitive user interfaces all the way to the databases on the other side of the wire.
</p>

<p>
  I have always been amazed at the impact software technology has on the world. I love that one person on one computer can build an entire software company and have it in front of millions of people in a short time. I am so fortunate to be in an industry of innovative and inquisitive thinkers that are highly passionate about changing the world through software.
</p>

<p>
  I am at the forefront of this frontier. I am a passionate leader and I take pride in my work. I have the grit to overcome challenges and adversity. I value working as a team and I believe it's vital for team members to have great communication and the drive to work together in order to build great software.
</p>

  When I'm not coding I like to cook, try new foods and cuisines, make my own coffee, listen to reggae music, play some chords on my ukulele, go to the beach, and read. I like to think of myself as a California beach kid. If I could code with my feet in the sand in a beach in San Diego I would!

<p>Mahalo! ðŸ¤™</p>
