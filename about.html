  Hi, my name is Keith Alpichi. I am a full-stack software engineer at Channelmeter in San Francisco, California. I enjoy building performant and scalable real-time applications from the intuitive user interfaces all the way to the databases on the other side of the wire.

  The impact software technology has on the world really amazes me. I love that one person on one computer can build an entire software company and present it instantly to millions of people. I am so fortunate to be in an industry of innovative and inquisitive thinkers who are highly passionate about changing the world through software.

  When I'm not coding I like to exercise, cook, enjoy different cuisines, make my own espresso, listen to reggae music, play some chords on my ukulele, go to the beach, and read. I like to think of myself as a California beach bum. If I could code with my feet in the sand on a beach in San Diego, I would!

  If you feel my vibe, contact me!

<p>Mahalo! ðŸ¤™</p>
