<h1>Where it all started</h1>

<p>I've always had a passion and curiosity for challenging myself to innovate. As a kid coming out of high school, I couldn't answer the challenging question of, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" That was a tough one because I always wanted to do many big things.</p>

<p>In spring of 2014 I graduated at San Jose State University with a Bachelors Degree in Kinesiology. Kinesiology is the field of exercise science, the human body, fitness and health. Six months prior I worked as a personal trainer at a corporate gym. In less than a year I quit to start my own mobile personal training business.</p>

<h1>One Door Closes, Another Opens</h1>

<p>As a personal trainer my job is to coach people about incorporating healthy habits into their lifestyle. For some clients this is simple. For others it is hard. I noticed a fault in the fitness industry. Fitness professionals don't teach habit formation very well. My curiosity struck again so I went head first into research studies and books about psychology.</p>

<p>What I found was simple and obvious... there is more to influencing someone else's life than just telling them what to do. Each person is different but the foundation of learning something, creating a simple habit, starts from taking small optimal steps that are relative to one larger goal.</p>

<p>I believe most people struggle with creating simple habits and performing them daily. So I took what I learned about behavior change psychology and combined it with my expertise in exercise and nutrition.</p>

<p>The results my clients received were astounding. They were creating habits quickly. Usually within a week or two my clients were performing tasks without feeling resistent or coerced. I knew I had discovered something. I was eager to share this knowledge on a global scale. I seeked guidance from a software engineer, whom also was a close friend of mines.</p>

<h1>The Birth of Havits Â©</h1>

<p>After days of conversation there was only one way I could accomplish this mission...to become a software engineer and build a company myself. We teamed up to start Havits- Accomplishing daily goals by sharing videos and photos with friends.</p>

<p>Ever since November 2015 I have been using my own experience and knowledge in habit formation to teach myself the fundamentals of software engineering.</p>

<p>With each day it is my daily habits that get me closer and closer to making this world a more productive and healthier world!</p>
