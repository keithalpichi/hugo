<h2>Confession and Disclaimer</h2>

<p><b>I am no way an expert programmer. To be honest, and as a disclaimer, I still consider myself an intermediate programmer. There are a lot of things I still need to learn. I still make mistakes and some of what I say on this website may be incorrect or inaccurate. If you find I have made a mistake somewhere please by all means let me know. I am more than open to learn how I can improve. Help me help others. I'm here to provide guidance to those who are new to programming while still learning myself.</b></p>

<h2>My Goals for This Website</h2>

<p>My name is Keith Alpichi. I am a self-taught web programmer/developer. I wasn't always a programmer though. I had a different career and decided to change it. Going back to school wasn't an option for me. I knew it would be difficult if I didn't go back to school but I was ambitious to give it a try.</p>

<p>It was also assuring that self-taught programmers was a <i>thing</i>. I've read everywhere that more and more people now a days are teaching themselves how to be software programmers. So it was possible!</p>

<p>The main motivation to avoid going back to school was to save money (I had already accumulated debt from my kinesiology degree) and time spent pursuing another degree. Furthermore if I realized I couldn't do it on my own I could always reconsider the college route. So I really had nothing to lose. Except for a little time spent teaching myself. And I still don't see that as a waste.</p>

<p>I first started programming in late 2015 and I learned a lot. I made a lot of progress but I hit a lot of challenges. <b>My goal for this website is to help other self-taught programmers learn programming and web development effectively and efficiently</b>.</p>

<p>The consequence of not going to school was not having mentors, teachers and peers to provide the education, help and connections. <b>Do I regret not going back to school to get a computer science degree? Not one bit!</b> So I hope to be your mentor, teacher and peer to provide you with the resources to become a software programmer that can build great things.

<h2>Where it all started</h2>

<p>I've always had a passion for learning and curiosity for challenging myself to innovate. As a kid coming out of high school, I couldn't answer the challenging question of, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" That was a tough one because I always wanted to do many big things.</p>

<p>In spring of 2014 I graduated from San Jose State University with a Bachelors Degree in Kinesiology. Kinesiology is the field of exercise science, the human body, fitness and health. Six months prior I worked as a personal trainer at a corporate gym. In less than a year I quit to start my own mobile personal training business.</p>

<h2>One Door Closes, Another Opens</h2>

<p>As a personal trainer my job is to coach people about incorporating healthy habits into their lifestyle. For some clients this is simple. For others it is hard. I noticed a fault in the fitness industry. Fitness professionals don't teach habit formation very well. My curiosity struck again so I went head first into research studies and books about psychology.</p>

<p>What I found was simple and obvious... there is more to influencing someone else's life than just telling them what to do. Each person is different but the foundation of learning something, creating a simple habit, starts from taking small optimal steps that are relative to one larger goal.</p>

<p>I believe most people struggle with creating simple habits and performing them daily. So I took what I learned about behavior change psychology and combined it with my expertise in exercise and nutrition.</p>

<p>The results my clients received were astounding. They were creating habits quickly. Usually within a week or two my clients were performing tasks without feeling resistent or coerced. I knew I had discovered something. I was eager to share this knowledge on a global scale. I had a business idea and I needed help to make it into a real business. I seeked guidance from a software engineer, whom also was a close friend of mine.</p>

<h2>The Birth of A Idea</h2>

<p>After days of conversation there was only one way I could accomplish this mission...to become a software programmer and build a company myself. We have teamed up to create Havits. It is still a work in progress but other than the name I can't share more than that.</p>

<p>Ever since November 2015 I have been using my own experience and knowledge in habit formation to teach myself the fundamentals of software programming.</p>

<p>With each day it is my daily habits that get me closer and closer to making this world a more productive and healthier world!</p>
